# TeamProfileGenProject

## Importing the folders

First, I needed to import the folders dist to hold the index.html and the style.css
Then the lib to hold the different classes such as employee.js, Engineer.js, Intern.js, and Manager.js
The test folder helps test weather the server will select the right employee, engineerm intern, or manager.

## Importing servers

I needed to import the express server, inquirer, jest, and save by using npm i to install the servers.
